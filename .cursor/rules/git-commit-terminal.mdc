# Git commits: terminal only, no co-author

- **Agent CAN push to git** when following established workflows, but MUST use terminal commands only.
- **Cursor must never appear on GitHub:** no Co-authored-by, no Cursor/cursoragent in messages, no Cursor as author. The Husky `commit-msg` hook strips co-author lines and any line containing "cursoragent"; terminal commits use your git config as author.
- **ALWAYS run `git commit` from the terminal (e.g. via the agent or a shell), using `git commit -m "..."` with the exact message. NEVER use Cursor’s Source Control / commit UI - it can bypass the hook and set Cursor as author or co-author on GitHub.
- For any “push to git”, “force to alpha” version bump, or other commit: run `git add` and `git commit -m "..."` in the terminal, then `git push` as needed. The hook automatically strips any Cursor mentions, but don't add them in the first place.
