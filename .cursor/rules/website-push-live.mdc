# Push website live

When the user says **"push website live"** (or similar: "deploy website", "publish website", "go live"), do **all** of the following so the site is in git and Cloudflare production is updated:

1. **Build** — From `website/`: run `npm run build` to verify the site builds.
2. **Commit & push to git** — If there are uncommitted changes: `git add -A`, `git commit` with a clear message (e.g. website or deploy-related), then `git push origin <current-branch>` (usually `master`).
3. **Update production** — Cloudflare Production deploys from the **`main`** branch. So after pushing to `master`, merge into `main` and push so production updates:
   - `git checkout main`
   - `git pull origin main`
   - `git merge master` (or the branch you just pushed)
   - `git push origin main`
   - `git checkout master` (or previous branch)

Do not only run `wrangler pages deploy` without also pushing to git and updating `main`. Pushing to `master` alone creates only a **Preview** deployment; production follows `main`.
